"Oder in the chaos and chaos in the order." This is how Osterhold describes one if the two essential directions of the chaos theory. Furthermore he claims, "processes, procedures or structures appearing very disordered only prove to be chaotic prior to they are analyzed further." This philosophical approach can be directly transfered to computer science, especially the field of information retrieval, data mining and data processing. 

\section{Motivation\label{sec:moti}}

The todays unbounded growth of information digitally available suggests a massive and chaotic collection of data. An in 2014 published report by EMC claims that the digitalized data grow by 100\% every two years and will reach 44 zettabytes (10\textsuperscript{21} bytes) - as many stars as known in the universe. 

Electronic data processing is applied math and relies therefor on data of a certain, deterministic structure. In computer science and mathematics there are well known specifications to transform and represent data in a computer understandable format. The canonical form, database normalization and schema definitions are some of them. Those are primary beneficial for generalizing representation and reduce storage overhead.

Specifications being as old as the computers itself seem to find less and less application. Developments according to Moore's law are the enable of that trend. 



\section{Objective and Problem statement\label{sec:objective}}

What kind of problem do you adress? Which issues do you try to solve? What solution do you propose? What is your goal?
'This thesis describes an approach to combining X and Y... The aim of this work is to...'

\section{Scope and Target\label{sec:scope}}

The target of this work is to present an overview of techniques, technologies and approaches available in different fields of computer science to tackle the stated problem. Furthermore, promising and adequate    

Here you should describe what you will do and also what you will not do. Explain a little more specific than in the objective section. 'I will implement X on the platforms Y and Z based on technology A and B.'

Conclude this subsection with an image describing 'the big picture'. How does your solution fit into a larger environment? You may also add another image with the overall structure of your component.

'Figure \ref{fig:intro} shows Component X as part of ...'

\section{Outline\label{sec:outline}}

The 'structure' or 'outline' section gives a brief introduction into the main chapters of your work. Write 2-5 lines about each chapter. Usually diploma thesis are separated into 6-8 main chapters. 
\\
\\
\noindent This example thesis is separated into 7 chapters.
\\
\\
\textbf{Chapter \ref{cha:chapter2}} is usually termed 'Related Work', 'State of the Art' or 'Fundamentals'. Here you will describe relevant technologies and standards related to your topic. What did other scientists propose regarding your topic? This chapter makes about 20-30 percent of the complete thesis.
\\
\\
\textbf{Chapter \ref{cha:chapter3}} analyzes the requirements for your component. This chapter will have 5-10 pages.
\\
\\
\textbf{Chapter \ref{cha:chapter4}} is usually termed 'Concept', 'Design' or 'Model'. Here you describe your approach, give a high-level description to the architectural structure and to the single components that your solution consists of. Use structured images and UML diagrams for explanation. This chapter will have a volume of 20-30 percent of your thesis.
\\
\\
\textbf{Chapter \ref{cha:chapter5}} describes the implementation part of your work. Don't explain every code detail but emphasize important aspects of your implementation. This chapter will have a volume of 15-20 percent of your thesis.
\\
\\
\textbf{Chapter \ref{cha:chapter6}} is usually termed 'Evaluation' or 'Validation'. How did you test it? In which environment? How does it scale? Measurements, tests, screenshots. This chapter will have a volume of 10-15 percent of your thesis.
\\
\\
\textbf{Chapter \ref{cha:chapter7}} summarizes the thesis, describes the problems that occurred and gives an outlook about future work. Should have about 4-6 pages.
