First of all, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Rüdiger Zarnekow at the Chair of Communication and Information Management for giving me the opportunity to carry out state of the art research in this field. As a joint thesis between the field of computer science and the field of communication and information management this thesis shows the necessity of knowledge exchange beyond organizational boundaries. The introduction of aspects going further then sheer technical views widened my horizon and resulted in a great and reusable result of this work.

Special thanks to Hannes Kübel for his guidance throughout the duration of this master thesis. His tutor abilities from my first idea sketch until the final commitment of the topic is more than mentionable.

Furthermore, I want to thank my family and friends for standing with me and supporting me personally trough the long period of the thesis. Not turning their back on me after silence from my side for several weeks and having an open ear on and understanding attitude. I never forget this kind of personal backing.
